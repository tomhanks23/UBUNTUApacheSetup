# Instructions for setting up a basic Apache environment on *UBUNTU ONLY*
# Specifically, these instructions are good for newer verions of Ubuntu
# that employ newer versions of Apache (2.4)
# 
# Note: File contents are denoted within hyphen lines below, you
# don't actually type the hyphens. Also, remember to replace [projectname]
# with your project name :)
#
 
# Note the -y option means answer yes for any questions
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y apache2 apache2-utils
 
# Remove any files/folders already in Apache's default webroot
$ sudo rm -rf /var/www/*
 
# Make a Virtual Host file, note the .conf extension
$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/[projectname].conf
 
# Create the following contents in your .conf file
#-----------------------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin your@email.com
    ServerName  [projectname].com
    #ServerAlias www.[projectname].com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/[projectname]/htdocs
    LogLevel warn
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
#------------------------------
 
# Make Project Folder
$ sudo mkdir /var/www/[projectname]
$ sudo mkdir /var/www/[projectname]/htdocs
 
# Make am index file in your new project
$ sudo echo 'hello world' > /var/www/[projectname]/htdocs/index.html
 
# Enable your Virtual Host file. You would only need to do this once
# per project. This stands for "Apache2 Enable Site"
$ sudo a2ensite [projectname].conf
 
# Soft reset Apache. Note that any changes to any apache '.conf' files
# will require this reload.
$ sudo service apache2 reload
 
# Since you created the website using sudo, it's currently owned by root. This sucks
# because now you will have to do sudo change anything in your project. To change
# the owner user to Apache, you can do this. The 'www-root' is the name of the Apache
# user in ubuntu. The -r part means 'recursively change this folder and
# all the sub folders/files'
$ sudo chown www-data:www-data -R /var/www/[projectname]
 
# Do this to make sure the project is owned by Apache now (based on the above line)
# You should see that the owner of the project folder is www-data
$ ls -la /var/www/[projectname]
 
##
# This part is optional, but if we want an easy-to-remember local domain name:
#
 
# Edit our local computer's hosts file
$ sudo nano /etc/hosts
 
# After the hosts file's default values, type this. And remember
# to match the domain name to whatever value you put in 'ServerName'
# of your VirtualHost file above
#-----------------------------
127.0.0.1   [projectname].com
#-----------------------------
 
##
# What if you want to disable a project?
#
 
# Disable Site
$ sudo a2dissite [projectname].conf
$ sudo service apache2 reload
